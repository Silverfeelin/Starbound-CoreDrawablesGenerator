# Starbound - Core Drawables Generator

A .NET Core implementation of [Silverfeelin/Starbound-DrawablesGenerator](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-DrawablesGenerator), powered by [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).

**Currently far from ready!**

This might not even reach a release as I'm mostly just experimenting with .NET Core and Avalonia, but if it does this drawables generator should work on Windows 10, Ubuntu and macOS Sierra without any dependencies.
